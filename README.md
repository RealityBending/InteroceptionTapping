# InteroceptionTapping
Exploratory analysis of the tapping task for implicit measuring interoception

- Can we use the cardiac phase effect on action to implicitly measure interoceptive abilities?

## TODO

- [ ] Preprocessing script to extract the timing of each tap and the closer pre and post heartbeat
- [ ] Analysis script to analyze this data using circular statistics
- [ ] Effect of trial order on the synchronization
- [ ] Compute participant-level indices
- [ ] Correlate them with other measures (HCT and questionnaires)
